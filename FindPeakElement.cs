/*
    A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

    Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the 
    array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

    You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

    T - O(logn), time complexity of binary search
    S - O(1), no additional space created for algorithm
