/*
    Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, 
    return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

    The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - 
    y2)2).

    You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that 
    it is in).
    
    T - O(Nlogk), we go through n length of points int[n][] to create hashmap of points and their euclidean 
                  distances. Then for maintaining pq order of these points by their distances takes logk time
    S - O(n + k), we create a hashmap to contain
